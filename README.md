# Password-Checker

Password Strength Checker Application
The Password Strength Checker application is a GUI-based program built using Python and the Tkinter library. Its primary purpose is to evaluate the strength of a password entered by the user and provide immediate feedback based on certain predefined criteria. This project showcases the effective use of Python for GUI design, input validation, and interactive user experiences.

The application assesses password strength using five key criteria. A strong password must be at least eight characters long, contain at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one numeric digit, and one special character (e.g., @ or #). Each criterion adds to the password’s overall strength score, which ranges from 1 (weakest) to 5 (strongest). By evaluating these attributes, the program ensures a comprehensive analysis of password robustness and encourages users to adopt safer password practices.

The graphical user interface (GUI) is central to the application's functionality. Users are presented with a clean and modern design, featuring a masked text entry field for password input. The masking, indicated by the use of asterisks (*), enhances security by hiding the password during typing. A toggle button allows users to reveal or hide their password as needed, offering both privacy and convenience. Once a password is entered, feedback is provided through a result label that displays the password’s strength level dynamically.

To make the feedback visually engaging, the program incorporates a color-coded system. The strength level is displayed in a color corresponding to its score, ranging from red for weak passwords to green for the strongest ones. This visual cue enhances usability, making it easier for users to interpret the results at a glance. The feedback is updated immediately upon submission, providing real-time evaluation of the entered password.

From a usability perspective, the application is designed to be intuitive and accessible. Users can trigger password evaluation by pressing the "Check Strength" button or by simply pressing the "Enter" key, ensuring a seamless interaction experience. The program also includes clear instructions and well-labeled buttons, ensuring that users of all skill levels can navigate it with ease.

Under the hood, the program leverages Python's re module to validate passwords using regular expressions. The check_password_strength function analyzes the entered password against the five criteria and returns a score based on how many are satisfied. Event handling is managed through dedicated functions. For example, the submit_password function retrieves the user’s input, evaluates it using the password strength logic, and updates the result label with the appropriate text and color. Similarly, the toggle_password_visibility function toggles the visibility of the entered password, dynamically updating the button text to reflect its current state.

The user interface is built with Tkinter, utilizing a modern black background for a sleek appearance. Key elements include a labeled prompt, the password entry field, a toggle visibility button, a submit button, and a result label. These elements are organized within a 400x250 pixel window, ensuring a compact yet functional design.

The Password Strength Checker is not only a practical tool but also a valuable learning project. It demonstrates the effective use of GUI programming and event-driven design principles. Additionally, the program is highly customizable, allowing for future enhancements such as disallowing dictionary words, suggesting improvements for weak passwords, or incorporating additional strength criteria.

In summary, this project combines Python programming, regular expressions, and Tkinter to create a functional and user-friendly application. By providing real-time feedback and encouraging users to adopt stronger passwords, the Password Strength Checker serves as both a practical tool and a showcase of programming and design expertise.
